Leader, risk-taker, and avid learner with an innate passion for creativity and freedom that provides the opportunity to exemplify our potential as human beings and exhibits the importance of human and social connection.

I strive to immerse myself in an environment where I love waking up the morning to work with innovative, passionate, and proactive people determined to enhance the wellbeing of others and remain virtuous regardless of the obstacles one must face. I enjoy immersing myself with people who yearn for continuous improvement throughout their personal and professional careers.

I'm captivated by what the world has to offer â€“ I'm a member of the Army National Guard and want to work with professionals in providing solutions for real-world issues. Applying my skillsets and knowledge towards specific problems, creating and reviewing reports, and briefing other professionals on dire issues, in addition to leading, planning, and delegating projects are things I strive to do in a work environment.
